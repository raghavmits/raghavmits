### Hello, my name is Raghav Mittal

I am a Data Scientist and Engineer with experience in driving operational improvements, energy optimization, and geospatial projects. I specialize in data modeling, data mining, inferential thinking techniques and predictive modeling to create, test, and deploy adaptive solutions that translate business requirements into impactful outcomes. 

I have extensive experience in designing and deploying cloud-native machine learning pipelines, automating ETL workflows, and optimizing data-intensive applications. My expertise includes working with AWS, GCP, and open-source frameworks to drive operational efficiency and innovation.

Recently, I built an end-to-end solution to analyze and optimize EV charging-related emissions using machine learning and real-time marginal emissions data. I also developed a computer-vision based reactor state analysis app and deployed it using AWS ECS and Fargate.

When I‚Äôm not working with data, I enjoy writing about machine learning, data engineering, and system design. I share insights through blog posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@raghavmittal) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghav-mittal/), aiming to contribute to the data science and engineering community.
